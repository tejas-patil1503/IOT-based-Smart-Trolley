# IOT-based-Smart-Trolley with Automatic billing system
basically we all are preferred to go Dmart and big malls for shopping of grocery and other things.
Because the place where all thing we buy at same location is known as Dmart. 
but the during a shopping time the problem is arise that problem we recognise and try to solve that problem by using our idea. 
The problem is after completing a shopping we all are waiting in queue for long time for billing. So thats why we represent our smart trolley.
Firstly when customer enter in a malls one persons standing at door step of mall that gives a token number as a password to the customer for giving a access of trolley
After getting a access of trolley customer login through a password in our website which is displayed on screen and screen is mounted on trolley. 
The website is made by using HTML, Css Js and php, SQL. 
By using website customer can explore a product and create a tentative list of products also which is most important is after buying all the products customer can pay bill by using multiple payment option like UPI cash and Card.
And the working of adding a product in a trolley is like when customer pick the product and try to add in a trolley product will scan automatically by using a RFID scanner and all the information regarding product is store in database and website will fetch the data from the database.
And one additional features we are implemented a chatbot that can help a customer to solve their basic problem at his level. And trolley is moving automatically by using wiper motor having torque 20.
In a future scope we added location of products and barcode sticker system also we create a robot like that can shop all the things according to list automatically without customer.
